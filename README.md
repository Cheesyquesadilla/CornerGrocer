# CornerGrocer

This project was meant to incorporate both Python and C++ to create a working program that used the text document provided to perform different tasks such as figuring out how many instances a certain item was mentioned, narrowing each instance down to just one word then putting a number next to it that represented how many times it was mentioned, and creating a histogram of that information. I felt I did the C++ part of the project well, however there is definetely room for imporvement. I feel I could use a different way to check user input so that the code could be shorter and more efficient. The histogram was the hardest part of the code. getting information from Python to then create a type of graph that is visually appealing was the most difficult part of the process. I tried to incorporate a way to seperate the item name from the number that was presented and put them in rows but I'm not sure it turned out exactly how I imagined. Using two different languages together will more than likely be the most useful part of this project. If I can master that then I feel that there will be many more opportunities for me when I graduate. I tried my best to describe what the code was menat to fo for the C++ part of the project since it is not as easily followed as Python. I wanted to make sure that someone who didn't have background in code could follow what was happening.
